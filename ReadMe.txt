This Project is related to a kaggle open dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality) which is a relational dataset about cause of death in US.

We extracted the records that contains one specific disease as a cause of death. These records are belonging to one of the 18 different categories of diseases based on the information in kaggle.

We have implemented different classifications such as SGD, K Nearest neighbour, and a simple Neural Net model. We have also tried the result considering PCA and without PCA. Chi2 feature selection is also applied here.
